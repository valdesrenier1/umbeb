    <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Fortunately for Umbe B, he’s already on track to become a legend alongside the artists he grew up listening to, from Daddy Yankee to Eminem. Prior to the days of social media, Umbe B found his audience through organic sharing and fan support; this rapid popularity without today’s digital tools is an impressive accomplishment in itself.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When it comes to writing music, Umbe B begins with a melody that develops in his mind. He’ll actively decide whether this is truly something no one has made before. (After all, these days we are surrounded by outside influences so much that it’s sometimes hard to distinguish between original thought and something we’ve heard somewhere.) He’ll then take that melody—at this point a sing-song approach without lyrics—back to his team. Working alongside a producer, he’ll transition from singing notes to writing lyrics over a bass beat. Like a true artist, Umbe B knows his worth and talent— that’s why he works with producers who can match his level of energy in the booth. The rest is musical magic and a dash of mixing and mastering.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">A social man, Umbe B loves spending time with the people he loves. He draws inspiration from the day-to-day stories of his close friends and family as well as his own experiences. Social issues—like women’s rights—also speak to him, and he frequently expresses his opinion through song. Like any romantic at heart, Umbe B is also not shy about writing love songs and falling in love. “I’m always creating,” expresses Umbe B of his passion for music. “I feel like I have a different personality than the rest—I want to give people something they don’t have. I want them to experience my art and beliefs.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">AS FEATURED ON</h2><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">

His lengthy performance experience coupled with solid showmanship make any Umbe B show a sight to be seen (and heard). With hits on par with those of Latin stars like Bad Bunny and Papi Juancho, it shouldn’t be long before Umbe B becomes a household name.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p><h1 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92pt;text-align: justify;">UMBE B</h1><p style="padding-top: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 25pt;text-align: justify;">Umbe B sets the stage for his own victory: to become the next champion, the King of Latin Music in Canada. From his humble beginnings as a musician in Cuba to a performer on European tours, Umbe B is quickly taking the world by storm, one song at a time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Umbe B’s music can best be described as a fusion of reggaetón, trap, and Latin, with underscores of grit, determination, and strength. His is an underdog story, and it shows in his music. Umbe demonstrates that hard work and perseverance can lead to great success—only if you are</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 21pt;text-align: justify;">willing to make the sacrifices needed to become the best.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span/></p></body>
